        <h5 class="project-heading">Description</h5>
        <p class="project-description">
            COMPFEST is the biggest student-led IT event in Indonesia. Compfest has several main events, namely, competition, job fair, quiz, and playground. This is the first time Compfest is being held online because of the pandemic.
        </p>
        <h5 class="project-heading">Goal</h5>
        <p class="project-description">
            The main goal of this project is to create an event website that has a good user interface and user experience to support the event's needs.
        </p>
        <h5 class="project-heading">Role and Responsibility</h5>
        <p class="project-description">
            As a staff in a UI/UX team of 6 members, I have a responsibility to do research and analysis to create a good website design.
        </p>

        <h5 class="project-heading">Process Flow</h5>

        <h6 class="project-heading-2">UX Research</h6>
        <p class="project-description">
            First, we researched potential web users. We categorize users based on last year's Compfest event. There are at least several user categories: IT students, non-IT students, lecturers, and high school students. This research aims to get the goals and problems of users.
        </p>

        <h6 class="project-heading-2">Define User Goals</h6>
        <p class="project-description">
            After we did a mini-research, we defined user goals. Hopefully, this can be a benchmark so that website design has a good meaning.

            Next, we define user problems that might occur based on previous mini-research concerns. Every team member writes user problems on figma.
